      <font size ="5">Canadian Sphynx is a hairless cat with abysmal eyes
The Canadian Sphynx is not only an unusual cat, but it is different. A mysterious creature that attracts attention, surprise, and makes you ask a lot of questions. The lack of fur on its soft skin and a deep, penetrating look won’t let anyone pass by without looking.
Surprisingly, sphinxes have several varieties of color and even a mustache. These mystical animals are loving, loyal friends to their owners, and require special care.
The Aztecs and South American Indians were the first to mention the appearance of the hairless cat. In the 1930s, cats of the hairless Mexican breed participated in American exhibitions. However, those feline species were not destined to live up to the present day.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Hairless cats were born in different parts of the world, and in the 1960s, purposeful breeding work began on the Canadian Sphynx breed. That is why several domestic shorthair cats began to give birth to hairless kittens.</font></p>

<p><h1><font size="6">Canadian Sphynx cat breed history</font></h1>
<font size="5">In 1966, Canada became the birthplace of the new breed of hairless cats. A kitten was named Prun, and the first offspring, which was not strong in health, came from him, and the history of the breed could again end in failure.

But almost simultaneously, in Toronto and the United States, hairless kittens were born, and these were sent to the Netherlands to an experienced breeder. He crossed hairless kittens with the Devon Rex breed. So in the genotype, resistance appeared, and it was possible to declare the existence of the Canadian Sphynx breed.

Not all kittens were born with the needed skin type and characteristic folds, but more and more cats were born, and the probability of successful mating increased. In Russia, sphynxes became more popular, and they started to actively breed them in the1990s.</font></p>

<p><h1><font size="6">Description and Breed Standard of Canadian Sphynx</font></h1>

     <font size="5">Canadian, Donskoy and Peterbald sphynxes are the main representatives of the hairless breed. Hairless cats from St. Petersburg are known as Peterbald. All types of these cats have their own characteristics.<br><br>

The Canadian Sphynxes cannot be described without mentioning the incredible amount of folds of skin they have. The more they have, the higher the value the animal has. The Canadian breed has them in large quantities. There is so much bare skin that even if the animal is stretched to its full length, it will still have folds.<br><br>

However, this cat is not completely hairless. The sphynxes skin is covered with a light fluff that feels like soft suede or peach skin. Short hair can be on paws, the scrotum, or external part of the ears. A puff of fur can sometimes appear at the end of the thin, refined, hairless tail.<br><br>
<ul>
<li>The body is medium-sized, muscular, and very hot to the human touch.</li><br>
<li>The body is formed by a broad chest, sometimes in the form of a barrel.</li><br>
<li>Limbs are slender and muscular, and the hind legs are longer than the front.</li><br>
<li>The joints of the fingers are pronounced.</li><br>
<li>The pads of the paws are thick, consistent with the overall color.</li><br>
<li>The head of the cat is wedge-shaped with prominent cheekbones and a straight nose.</li><br>
<li>The neck is muscular and long.</li><br>
<li>On top of the head, there are small folds of skin.</li><br>
<li>Important characteristics of cats are their eyes; they are shaped like a lemon and have huge, prick ears – pointed or rounded.</li><br>
<li>Canadians may experience heterochromia of one eye or both.</li><br>
<li>Despite the fact that their ancestors had a mustache, the sphynxes did not inherit them.</li><br>
<li>Even the largest sphynxes don’t weight more than 5-6 kg.</li><br>
For a long period of time, sphynxes could look into a person’s eyes without looking away. And it is difficult for the owner to take his eyes off the huge, slightly slanted, attentive eyes of their pet. Their expression feels as if the cat is ready to jump at any moment.
