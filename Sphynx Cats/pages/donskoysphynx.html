      <h1><font size="6">Don Sphynx – a good-natured and lazy, bald cat</font></h1>
        <font size="5">Don Sphynx is a fairly new breed of hairless cat, whose appearance was the result of a spontaneous mutation and not a purposeful crossing of already existing bald breeds.

Good-natured, slightly lazy, and very intelligent Russian Sphynx cats quickly took their niche among many other breeds. Their alien appearance and aristocracy appealed to the hearts of cat lovers around the world.</font></p><br>

<p><font size="6"><h1>The origin of the breed</h1></font>
<font size="5">The history of the Don Sphynx breed began when Elena Kovaleva, a Rostov woman, was returning home in the evening and saw a trembling, wet lump on the street, which, upon closer examination, turned out to be a skinny stray cat. It is not known whether we would know of such a breed if the woman with the kind heart had not taken pity on the poor creature. Elena took the cat home and called her Barbara.<br>

In the new house, the cat quickly settled in, ate, but began to rapidly lose hair. The hostess treated her pet with all sorts of medicine: against rash, then against dermatitis, then for lack of vitamins. After noticing that Barbara did not feel the lack of fur and her health was better than ever, Elena decided to consult with experts. It turned out to be a mutation at the gene level.<br>

When Barbara grew up, she gave birth to kittens, having mated with an ordinary yard cat, and the whole litter inherited this genetic anomaly – a small fluff instead of fur, which eventually completely disappeared. We only know about one kitten with certainty from this litter – Chita, which went to Irina Nemikina. Irina subsequently became the first breeder of the domestic cat breed.<br>

The Don (Rostov) Sphynx has no common roots to Canadian Sphynx cats. However, the excitement around the Canadians contributed to the popularization of the new breed, both in Russia and abroad.<br>

Just a few years after the miraculous rescue of the unusual cat, Barbara, from the street, her descendants were already recognized by the International Felinological Association as an experimental cat breed (1992), and the official status of the Don breed was received in 1996.<br>

The breed was named because of its similarity to the ancient Egyptian cats and the name of the region in which it began to be bred. Among other options were such names as “Skif,” “Dandelion,” “Cossack,” and ”Hairless.”</font></p>

<p><h1><font size="6">Canadian Sphynx cat breed history</font></h1>
<font size="5">In 1966, Canada became the birthplace of the new breed of hairless cats. A kitten was named Prun, and the first offspring, which was not strong in health, came from him, and the history of the breed could again end in failure.

But almost simultaneously, in Toronto and the United States, hairless kittens were born, and these were sent to the Netherlands to an experienced breeder. He crossed hairless kittens with the Devon Rex breed. So in the genotype, resistance appeared, and it was possible to declare the existence of the Canadian Sphynx breed.

Not all kittens were born with the needed skin type and characteristic folds, but more and more cats were born, and the probability of successful mating increased. In Russia, sphynxes became more popular, and they started to actively breed them in the1990s.</font></p>

<p><h1><font size="6">Description and Breed Standard of Canadian Sphynx</font></h1>

     <font size="5">The description of the Don Sphynx breed needs to start with its distinctive features; that is, the lack of fur. Unlike Canadians, hairless cats are completely without any fur. The skin feels very nice – it is hot and velvety. On the paws, stomach and groin area, the skin is gathered in folds, which is especially noticeable with kittens..<br><br></font></p>

<p><h1><font size="6">The standard breed provides four types of skin versions:</font></h1><br><br>

<ul><font size="5">
<li>Rubber Bald (completely without fur, skin resembles human skin, only hotter).</li><br>
<li>Flock (there is barely noticeable fluff, and it feels like the skin of a peach or an apricot).</li><br>
<li>Velour (the length of the soft plush fur that is no more than 2-3 mm long. It may disappear with age).</li><br>
<li>Brush (has hard, short, curly hair that looks similar to lambs).</li><br></ul></font></p><br>
<p><font size="5">Brush Sphynx cats are not exhibited and do not have titles but are very important for breeding work since the probability of the appearance of genetic diseases is significantly reduced.<br>
  The Don Sphynx cat breed is elegant, graceful and noble. It is hard to imagine that this breed came from a simple yard cat.<br><br>

 </font></p> 
 <p>
 <ul><font size="5">
<li>The body is muscular, slender and has a fairly wide backbone.</li><br>
<li>The head is triangular, medium size.</li><br>
<li>Ears are large, also in the shape of a triangle, and tips are rounded.</li><br>
<li>The eyes are expressive, slightly slanted, and shaped like two tonsils. <br>Eye color can be walnut, green, blue, yellow.</li><br>
<li>Don Sphynx cats have a small, neat nose.</li><br>
<li>Whisker pads are pronounced, eyebrows and whiskers may be present in small quantities, or may be absent at all.</li><br>
<li>Paws and tail-elongated, flexible, showing off grace and lightness.<br> Back paws are a bit longer than the front.<br> The paws are elongated, and fingers seem longer due to the lack of hair.</li><br>
<li>The tail is similar to a mouse’s tail.</li><br>
An interesting feature of the Don Sphynx breed is the periodic appearance of soft fluff on their delicate skin, which can disappear from time to time. These metamorphoses are associated with the weather and time of year, with hormonal background, and even with a change in diet.
