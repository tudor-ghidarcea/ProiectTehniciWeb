      <h1><font size="6">Peterbald Sphynx</font></h1>
        <font size="5">The Peterbald Sphynx is a peaceful and noble breed. These cats never feel alone. They are very attached to their owner and will show affection towards other family members.<br>

These cats are very friendly and intelligent. They make friends with adults as easily as the small ones of the family. As well, they are very friendly with other house pets, including dogs.<br>

They differ from other cats as they have no fur. Hairless cats have been popular for many years. At first, these breeds were considered exotic, but nowadays, Sphynx owners know that this is a smart and very friendly pet.</font></p><br>

<p><font size="6"><h1>Peterbald Breed Origins</h1></font>
<font size="5">The second name of this breed is Peterbald or Neva Sphynx. Cats were given this name as they were first bred in St. Petersburg. Olga Mironova was the Felinologist that brought them out.<br>

Tatjana Komarova helped by being the owner of the male Sphynx. It was a Don Sphynx by the name of Anthenogen Myth. The mom of the kittens was an oriental cat named Radma Von Jagenhorf. As a result of mating, four kittens were born.<br>

From the Don Sphynx, the Peterbalds received the gene of no hair and from the mother – gracefulness, a sharp shape of the head and long legs.<br>

In 1996, the breed was registered, and in 2003, it was recognized by the World Cat Association.</font></p>
